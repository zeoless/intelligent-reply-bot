# Intelligent Reply Bot

An intellectual reply bot project developed using Python, specializing in suggesting short responses to texts or emails via Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks.

## What Does It Do?

The aim of this project is to design a bot that simulates human-like conversations by suggesting quick responses to a received text or email, making it a type of chatbot. Its use case is primarily focused on casual conversation.

At a high level, there are two main variants of chatbots: **rule-based** and **self-learning**:
* A **rule-based** bot responds based on defined patterns and rules.
* A **self-learning** bot responds based on machine learning models.
  * **retrieval-based** bot selects the best response from a predefined list.
  * **generative-based** bot generates a unique response using deep learning algorithms.

To understand the tradeoffs of different types of bots better, rule-based, retrieval-based, and machine learning based bots were implemented in this project.
